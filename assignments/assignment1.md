# Assignment 1: Problem Framing

## Domains:
1. Springboard diving: tracking progress, organizing training

    - I switched from gymnastics to diving in high school and am now in my third year on MIT's Dive team; I love the thrill and perfectionist aspects of the sport! Diving is also very personally rewarding, and I enjoy tracking my progress across meets and seasons. However, there's a lot of data across scores and videos, and it's difficult to organize.

2. Traveling: documenting and planning trips

    - I love the excitement of traveling to new places to see the sights, enjoy new foods, and gain cultural experiences. Now that I'm a college student and have started making my own money, the possiblities of future trips abroad and across the country have opened up. I always take pictures and journal about my travel experiences, but I don't have a centralized way to remember where I've been to or the memories that I made there.

3. Cooking: organizing recipes, documenting meals

    - I grew up cooking dinner for my family and would enjoy finding and collecting new recipes to try, which we'd give star ratings to and collect in huge binders that eventually became overwhelmingly full. I also love looking back on the special memories when we've followed treasured family recipes with our grandma or other relatives, but I have no way to organize these details.

<!-- I have three sisters, and we were always very close growing up. Now that three of us are away at college, while my younger sister is home in high school, it's harder to stay connected. There's a lot of communication to figure out when we're free to call, and sometimes I forget and let more time pass than I would've liked. Finally, so much happens in my day-to-day life that I never remember to share. -->

4. Wellbeing: tracking self-care, culminating habits

5. My pet cat: coordinating care, sharing media

6. Listening to music: giving song recommendations, tracking habits

7. Family: staying connected, sharing regular updates

8. Writing poetry: organizing drafts, displaying poems

9. Reading books: sharing thoughts, giving recommendations

10. Photography: organizing and displaying favorite photos

## Problems:

### Springboard Diving

1. **Tracking personal records:** I enjoy tracking my scores for each meet of the season, but this data becomes difficult to conceptualize with both 6- and 11-dive meets on both 1- and 3-meter boards. Additionally, I'd like to track my top scores on individual dives across both boards. Finally, I often video my training and competition dives for future reference, but these videos become lost among hundreds of others, so there's no simple way to look back on my best 105C or 205C dives while preparing for a meet.

    - I chose to select this problem because it has a nice balance of being simple enough to actually develop but also very applicable, filling a specific niche that can still appeal to all of my teammates. Addtionally, it's a project that I'm especially passionate about because I'm so detail-oriented, and it can be adopted immediately with the data that I've collected so far.

2. **Ranking/reviewing best college boards/pools:**

    - I chose not to select this problem because although it would be helpful to create a culmination of past knowledge about the bounciness of certain boards, the water temperature, and more, dive coaches and athletes from other teams would likely not be pleased with being ranked. Additionally, right from the start, it would require active users providing reviews in order to take off, so it may be that this information is instead best passed down my word-of-mouth or determined by firsthand experience.

3. **Planning practices:**

    - I chose not to select this problem because while it would be helpful to have a clear organizational app for coaches to use to plan and communicate workout details for each diving training session, it doesn't seem like a serious or niche enough issue to require an entirely new application. Additionally, coaches may be resistant to integrating new technology into their practice preparation routines.

### Traveling

1. **Recording places traveled:** I went abroad for the first time this past summer for a MISTI opportunity in the UK. I've wanted a way to track the countries that I visited beyond a simple Keep Notes tab, and I've also started making a bucket list of where I'd like to travel to next. Finally, I've been to dozens of US states growing up, but I can never remember which ones or what my family did there.

    - I chose to select this problem because it seems widely applicable due to the fact that so many people travel and are excited about where they've been. It's also an app that I've been wanting to find for myself recently, so I'm passionate about making it myself. Additionally, because the restaurant tracking app Beli has taken off so strongly recently, it seems like a similar idea for the domain of travel would also do well.

<!--Titles:  (Away/Postcards) (Beli: tracking restaurants; basically like a cooking social media) -->

2. **Travel updater:**

    - I chose not to select this problem because while it could be fun and desireable to share your travels with friends in real-time and receive live updates, I'm not sure that there's a need beyond Google Maps, Life360, and other location sharing apps. Additionally, there are serious privacy concerns that would have to be addressed in order to assure that locations are never undesirably shared, and the app seems like it would be a bit limited in its scope.

3. **Trip planning:**

    - I chose not to select this problem because LLMs can now create sufficiently detailed travel itineraries, and there already exist many extensive trip-planning resources online, from articles to Reddit posts. Additionally, because I'm not usually the itinerary-maker of the group, this idea doesn't offer much personal value and wouldn't be exciting to me to create.

### Cooking

1. **Collecting family recipes:** My family has many valued recipes that have been passed down over the years, including my grandma's famous One Egg Cake and my aunt's Spanish rice. We also have favorites that we've discovered or created ourselves, from shrimp and gnocchi to cherry pie. While I've digitzied some of the recipes in Google Docs, it never feels special enough to house an entire family cookbook and also lacks the memories of when and with whom certain meals were made.

    - I chose to select this problem because the desire to preserve family recipes and share them among relatives seems widespread, and this would be a simple enough app to create. Also, this problem remains relevant to me; I would personally enjoy creating and sharing a digital cookbook for my family.

2. **Finding recipes:**

    - I chose not to select this problem because I'm not sure that an app I made would be more effective than simply searching for recipes with Google or an LLM, which can handle customized requests. Additionally, my surrounding peers are mostly on meal plans or cook simple college meals, and wouldn't necessarily find great use in a recipe finder right now.


3. **Weekly meal planner:**

    - I chose not to select this problem because meal planning can already be done with a typical agenda app or system, from Notion to a paper book, and I'm not convinced a new app could do better without becoming complicated. Also, while it might be helpful for parents who cook at home, it isn't very applicable to me currently because I tend to eat at the dining halls.

## Problem 1 - Springboard Diving: tracking personal records

### Stakeholders

- **Stakeholders:** Diver (the athlete tracking their progress on the app), Teammate (other divers on the team), Coach (the diver's coach), Recruiter (a coach interested in recruiting divers)

- **Impacts:** Diver benefits from tracking their progress, and Teammates might either improve or suffer due to having such easy access to and comparing themselves to Diver's stats. Coach and Recruiter are both interested in the Diver's records, and Recruiter would especially benefit from being able to see many Divers' stats. Finally, the Diver is impacted by the Recruiters viewing their profile.

### Evidence & Comparables

- **Evidence:**
    1. [Nationwide, NCAA women's and men's college diving programs total 380 and 479, respectively](http://www.usadiver.com/diving_articles/opinion/dive_in_to_college.htm#:~:text=There%20are%20380%20NCAA%20Division,men%20and%20479%20for%20women.): There are thousands of college divers enrolled in competitive programs across the US who dedicate their undergrad to diving training and meets.

- **Comparables:**
    1. [DiveMeets - Diving Meets Management System](https://secure.meetcontrol.com/divemeets/system/index.php): DiveMeets is a well-established platform that hosts information on meets, divers, coaches, and more. While it tracks top scores of individual dives, it doesn't allow video integration or tracking of meet totals, and not all meets use DiveMeets.
    2. [DiveLive - Complete Meet Management Application](https://scoresandmore.live/): DiveLive is a new app that's also meet-focused: it helps to run meets and tracks meet data, with score and video integration. However, it's also only used for a subset of meets and doesn't track any individual data.
    3. [Swimcloud - Swim Meet Management](https://www.swimcloud.com/): Swimcloud is a swim-focused platform for swim meets that also records data for certain dive meets, but it's not diver-focused.
    4. [MySkillChart - Skill Tracking Software](https://www.myskillchart.com/): MySkillChart is an app that's built for a business to track their clients' progress in different skills. However, the end goal seems to be completing a given skill, and it's organized to allow tracking an entire class of people, rather than to be used for an individual.
    5. [iDiveScore - the Dive Scoring App](http://idivescore.com/) - iDiveScore is a mobile app that allows users to track a diver's meet scores and progress over time. However, it has an outdated UI and recieved very poor reviews.
    6. [Dive List](https://apps.apple.com/mk/app/dive-list/id454640919) - Dive List is a simple app with a poor UI that helps with dive list creation and dive score sampling. While it allows lists to be shared, it doesn't have progress tracking over time or video support.

        <!-- 4. https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/gymnast-journal/id6738031442 -->


### Features

1. **Score Tracking:** You can input and update your best score for each dive, as well as your best overall meet totals. These PR's could potentially be updated automatically from dive sheets or related software.

2. **Video Upload:** You can upload one or more videos under a certain dive. Each video has the option to include its date, location (training or a meet), score (if applicable), and any other comments.

3. **Friends/Followers:** You can connect with other divers to view their stats and videos, with customizable privacy settings for each component. Additionally, college recruiters can follow divers to assess their capabilities.

## Problem 2 - Traveling: recording places traveled

### Stakeholders

- **Stakeholders:** Traveler (the person documenting their travels with the app), Partner (someone who usually accompanies them on their travels), Friend (someone digitally following along with their travels), Developer (developer of other travel recording apps)

- **Impacts:** Traveler and Partner both benefit from the recording of travel memories, and Friend enjoys following along and may become a Traveler themself if the app takes off in popularity. Developer is negatively impacted by users switching away from their app but could benefit if users have the ability to integrate the Developer's own software.

## Problem 3 - Cooking: collecting family recipes

### Stakeholders

- **Stakeholders:** Collector (someone who actively adds recipes to the digital cookbook), Family (someone who views the cookbook either in the present or future), Author (traditional cookbook author)

- **Impacts:** Collector benefits from being able to compile their personal recipes and is interested in Family viewing their recipes. Family relies on Collector to create recipe collection for their use, and younger Family members in future generations are gifted the preservation of recipes by Collector. Author might be negatively impacted by Collector and Family referencing family recipes over traditional cookbooks.

### Evidence & Comparables
