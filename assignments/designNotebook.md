Ideas:
name: away
user has a home location (or can track multiple home locations)

main features:
- postcards
- wishlists
- friends

main pages:
- create new postcard
- postcards view
- map view


eventual LLM feature idea: recommending items for the wish list (add recommending concept)


is the emphasis on the places traveled to or the trips? -- I think on the trips: so each place has its own post and you can edit/add dates to be able to update past posts

thought about having social feed -- but more like spotify than linkedin because focus is on tracking, not sharing

was going to make wishlists similarly open up to an editable place but really only entering a location

debated what summary to show on the friends home page - can't see quick overview if such given icons (but that's how spotify does it) -- see if too difficult to implement

made description and gallery non optional because can just be empty

future ideas: implement tags/be able to sort home screen chronologically and by region; be able to add friends to a given trip and it'll show up in their page as well
